# Allods and Rage of Mages Character Auto-Backup

This program can be used to monitor and automatically backup character files that are created when playing *Multiplayer* (*Сетевая игра*) mode.

Up to 5 backups will be consistently created as character is being saved in the game, in addition an extra backup will be created when the program notices a drop in file size from above-1000 bytes to below-1000 bytes (which is usually occurs when the character is killed). In addition, if the character file is deleted, the files will be converted into archived versions that can be restored into normal state at any point. Archived characters can only be deleted manually be removing the following files: archiveXXXX.arch from the game folder and archiveXXXX.arch.bakY from the backups folder that is in the game folder.

## Installation

Unpack the downloaded zip-file into the same folder where the game is installed.

## Usage

Start this program before starting the Allods/Rage of Mages game. To avoid any issues, it's best to close the game before manipulating the files using this program (like resurrecting the character or restoring one from the archive).

It's unknown whether this program can be used with Allods 2/Rage of Mages, since it wasn't tested with one, but the possibility is not out of the question.
